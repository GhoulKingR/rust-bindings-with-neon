# Reading and writing files

Reading and writing files is one of Rust's core features.

If you're building a more data-intensive application, it is more effective to use a more powerful language like Rust. JavaScript doesn't perform well in situations that need very high performance, whereas Rust can.

If you open the `src/lib.rs` file, you'll notice that file handling here is exactly the same as when you're only using Rust.

## How to run this project

To run this project, there are a few things you must do first:

1. `cd` to this folder in your terminal
2. Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

These steps will help you with installing the Rust and JavaScript dependencies, as well as compiling the Rust code. If you just want to compile the Rust backend, run this command:

```bash
npm run build
```

When the steps are completed, run the `index.js` file in the terminal:

```bash
node index.js
```
